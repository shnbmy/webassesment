Colmar Academy Practice 

What did you like about this project?
  - It made me realised the areas I'm weak in & need to work more on.

What did you struggle with in this project?
   - As I'm still not that good in CSS, I had difficulties making the alignments and getting the elements the way I want it to behave.


What would make your experience with this assessment better?
   - I will need to really brush up on my CSS, especially Flexbox, get someone to teach me if the online resources still does not help me.
